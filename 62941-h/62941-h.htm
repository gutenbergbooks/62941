<p class='c006'>I have written this book
for little boys. I hope they
may like it; although it does
not contain any wonderful
stories about giants, or genii,
or fairies.</p>

<p class='c007'>I wanted to do them good,
as well as to amuse them.
Although I do not mention
the name of the Saviour in
every chapter, I yet try to
talk of things that will lead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>their minds up to him. I
wish them to feel how good
he has been to them, in
giving them kind parents to
teach them his word, health
to enjoy the beauties of creation,
and in bestowing on
them so many other mercies.</p>

<p class='c007'>That they may love the
Redeemer in their early
years, and at last dwell with
him in heaven, is the prayer
of their friend,</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Alfred Penrose</span> was a little
boy who lived in a pretty town
on the banks of the Connecticut
River. We will call the place in
which Alfred lived Norwood, although
that is not its real name.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the weather was warm
Alfred’s father would often take
him and his older brothers in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>little boat upon the river. Sometimes
they would row to a pleasant
creek, over which large trees
drooped their branches until they
touched the water. There Alfred’s
father and brothers would
catch fish, which they carried
home to have cooked for breakfast
the next morning. They
were not cruel enough to use
worms for bait. They baited
their hook with pieces of raw
meat, or dough, which the fish
liked quite as well as worms.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Alfred’s brothers helped
their father to fish, the little boy
would steal away from them to
a small brook which ran through
the meadow where his father allowed
him to go by himself, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>there was no danger. Mr.
Penrose did not like to have Alfred
too near him when he was
fishing. The little fellow’s merry
laugh and loud voice frightened
away the fish. So, as we have
said, Alfred would steal away to
the little brook, and launch the
shingle boat, with its paper sails,
which his brother Harry had
made for him; or pick his way
across the brook on the stepping
stones to the sunny bank, in
search of the beautiful flowers
which peep forth from among
the withered leaves of the last
year. And handfuls of the pretty
light blue flower called innocence
would he gather, for it is found
everywhere in its season, smiling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>in wood and meadow, by
shaded streams, and in the glittering
sunshine.</p>

<p class='c007'>O, very pleasant was the budding
spring-time, and the rich,
ripe summer season, to little
Alfred!</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they would often bring
their dinner with them, and eat
it by the pebbly brook, which
sung its sweet tune to them as it
danced along, and mingled its
voice with the merry birds which
saluted them from the trees above
their heads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred’s father always received
his son’s little love-offering of
flowers with a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad my little boy loves
flowers,” he would say. “They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>are God’s beautiful presents to
us. How sweetly Jesus speaks
of flowers in Matthew vi, 28-30:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Consider the lilies of the
field how they grow; they toil
not, neither do they spin: and
yet I say unto you, that even
Solomon, in all his glory, was
not arrayed like one of these.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wherefore, if God so clothe
the grass of the field, which to-day
is, and to-morrow is cast into
the oven, shall he not much more
clothe you, O ye of little faith?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>When</span> little Alfred returned
home, on a Saturday afternoon,
from one of the delightful visits
to the woods of which I have
told you, his mamma lifted him
up on the sofa beside her, and
said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“How good our heavenly Father
is to my little Alfred! He
has given him a kind papa, who
loves him dearly. Little boys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>cannot be thankful enough to
God for that great blessing.
There are many little children
who have very unkind fathers.
Some of them are wicked enough
to spend all their money for rum,
and do not get anything for their
poor little children to eat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred’s little sister Flora had
run up to her mamma, to listen
to her as she talked with Alfred.
She was a tender-hearted little
girl, and her lip quivered, and
the tears came into her eyes,
when she heard about the children
who had such naughty fathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Mrs. Penrose took little
Flora upon her lap, and went on
talking to Alfred. She said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“And my little Alfred’s papa
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>takes him in the pleasant woods,
and in the fields, and lets him
gather the sweet flowers which
grow there. And he and little
Flora can hear the happy birds
sing all day long. Now, there
are some little children who
never see a flower grow, or hear
a bird sing, and they scarcely
even see the pretty blue sky
which is over their heads.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, mamma!” said Alfred,
“are they blind and deaf?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my love, but they live in
dark and crowded places in the
city. Some live in garrets, and
some in cellars, where the houses
are high and the streets very narrow.
So the beautiful things
which God has given us to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>us glad are quite shut out from
them. When I lived in the city
I went one day to see a poor
family who lived in a cellar, in a
dark and dirty court. The father
of this family was a drunkard.
He had even sold, for rum,
the bed on which his sick wife
lay. When I went to her, the
poor woman had only some
straw, in a corner of the cellar,
to lie upon. The children had
very little fire, although the weather
was cold, and nothing to eat,
except what people carried them
from day to day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Among the children was one
pale, sickly-looking little boy,
named Johnny. He was only
eight years old; but his mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>told me that she did not know
what she should have done without
little Johnny. He did everything
that he could for her during
the day; and when she coughed
or moved at night, the little boy
would run up to her and ask her
if she would have some water,
or if he should raise her head
higher.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a corner, Johnny had a
faded rose planted in some dirt
which he had scooped from the
cellar, and put in an old tin cup.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The rose had been, one day,
dropped by a lady, who was
walking before Johnny, in Broadway.
Johnny was an honest boy.
He ran up to the lady, and offered
her the rose which she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>dropped. The lady smiled, and
said, ‘You can keep it, my little
boy. I do not want it.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The rose was then fresh and
beautiful. Johnny thought that
if he planted it, it might perhaps
live. It did take root even in
that poor soil, but it could not
grow any.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He looked up into my face,
on the day that I first went to
see his mother, and said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘O, ma’am! do you think
that my rose will live? I have
kept it in the warmest place, and
watered it every day.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes,’ said his mother, ‘however
hungry and cold poor Johnny
has been, he never forgot his
rose.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“I saw when he asked me the
question that his rose was nearly
dead. The tears came into his
eyes when I told him this.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor little boy! The flower
was like himself, withering away
for want of light and air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just think, Alfred, how happy
little Johnny would have been,
running with his bare feet through
the fields, looking at the golden
and speckled butterflies, filling
his cap with wild-flowers, and
listening to the song of the birds,
and the busy hum of the honey-bee!</p>

<p class='c007'>“One day I took Johnny to
my house, and showed him a
stand of flowers. He was delighted.
He clapped his hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and his eyes sparkled. He smelt
the heliotropes and the roses, and
he looked at the rich flowers of
the cactus. When I gave him a
bouquet to carry to his own miserable
home, he seemed perfectly
happy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The next time I went to that
dark, gloomy cellar, there the
flowers stood in the old tin cup
from which the poor rose had
been taken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred and Flora felt sorry for
poor Johnny; but they were glad
to hear that his mother got well,
and that little Johnny had been
put with a farmer, where he could
hear the birds sing, and see the
brooks and the trees, and pick
wild-flowers in the fields.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>When they went to bed they
thanked God for many mercies
which they had not thought of
before.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>If</span> the summer season and the
spring-time were pleasant to little
Alfred, so also were the winter
hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the snow came—the
fair, beautiful snow, falling so
softly and quietly upon the frozen
ground, and making every tree
look like a fairy bower—Alfred
ran about the house, singing:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I love the snow, the first white snow,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That decks the merry earth.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>When Alfred was very little
he had no sled of his own; but
his friends, Charles and Arthur
Brown, used now and then to
give him a ride upon their sled.
This he always enjoyed very
much.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he was four years old,
Alfred said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, father, I do wish that I had
a sled of my own!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why do you wish to have a
sled of your own, my son?” said
his father. “The boys are so
kind as to give you a ride every
day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know it, papa,” said
Alfred; “but I am afraid they
take me sometimes when they
want to ride themselves. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>then you know I can only go to
ride when their school is out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed,” said Alfred’s mother,
“I have thought lately that
I would like Alfred to have a
sled of his own. He gets his
lessons quickly now, so that he
is quite through them by eleven
o’clock. If he had a little sled
he could slide down the terrace
two hours before dinner time. It
would be good exercise for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred’s father looked pleased
to hear that he got his lessons
quickly. He said, “I think if Alfred
continues to study well he
must have a sled of his own.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, father! do please get me
one, and have it painted green,
with a black stripe around it.”</p>

</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When the north winds blow, on my sled I go,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a bounding heart, o’er the glitt’ring snow;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or swift on the clear, cold ice I glide,</div>
      <div class='line'>With my watchful father close by my side.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>O, how</span> very much pleased
was Alfred to find the sled he
had asked for standing by his
bed one morning when he awoke!
As soon as he had washed and
dressed himself, and said his
prayers, he ran to thank his dear
father for his nice present. Alfred’s
mamma had bought him a
woolen cap, which she wadded
and lined, and he had a warm
plaid cloak; so he was quite
ready for his first ride.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The snow was frozen very
hard, so that the upper crust bore
the sled; and merrily, merrily
indeed did the little boy slide
swiftly down the terrace, and
even to the very bottom of the
lawn. He did not mind pulling
the sled up the hill for the pleasure
of riding down.</p>

<p class='c007'>By and by he looked up at the
bed-room window, and saw his
little sister Flora’s face looking
at him through one of the panes.
Alfred was not a selfish boy. He
liked to share every pleasure with
his sister.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, my poor little Flora!” said
he, “you must come out and
have a ride too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So he left his sled, and ran
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>into the house to ask his mother
if she would not let Flora ride
upon the sled. At first his mamma
said she was afraid it was
too cold for Flora; but when Alfred
promised to take great care
of her, she said that she might go
out with him for a little while.
She put on Flora’s warm cap,
and coat, and mittens, and comforter,
and stood by the window
to watch the little ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>O, how they both enjoyed it!
Alfred was very much pleased to
have Flora put under his care.
He kept her feet covered up, and
drew the sled down the terrace
very carefully. After a little
while Mrs. Penrose sent Ann
out to bring Flora into the house.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>When Mr. Penrose came home
to dinner, he asked Alfred how
he had enjoyed the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, father,” said Alfred, “I
have been so happy! How much
I thank you for my new sled! I
will be a very good boy for it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope you will be a good
boy, Alfred,” said his papa.
“You must ask God to keep
you from doing wrong; for you
know, I suppose, that it is only
through his help that we can do
a right action. I am always
afraid when I hear people boast
of what they intend to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after this, Alfred’s father
bought him a beautiful little pair
of skates, and took him upon the
pond to teach him to skate.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>He had thought that winter
was almost as pleasant as summer
when he first rode upon his
sled; but now that he could skate
too, he forgot all the pleasures of
the summer, and, like Tommy in
the looking-glass, wished that it
could be “always winter.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Before</span> little Alfred could
read he knew a great deal of the
Bible. He had a volume of
Scripture plates, which he would
turn over upon his father’s knee,
and ask him the meaning of
them. Alfred’s father loved the
Bible, and he wanted his children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>to love it too; and therefore he
took great delight in explaining
it to them, and in telling them
the beautiful stories which it contains.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was the picture of Jacob
dreaming his sweet dream about
the ladder which reached to heaven,
on which the angels of God
came and went.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there was brave Daniel in
the lions’ den; because he <i>would</i>
worship God when the king said
he should not.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there, too, was faithful
Abraham, about to offer up to
God “his son, his only son
Isaac,” whom he loved.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these, and many more delightful
stories from the Bible, Alfred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>and Flora would repeat before
they could read.</p>

<p class='c007'>They both thought and talked
a great deal about the Bible.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, in the summer time,
Alfred and Flora went out together
into the garden. They
sat down upon a seat under the
willow-tree. Little Flora took
her doll in her arms when she
went out; but when they returned
to the house she did not have
it with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Flora, where is your doll?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, brother,” said Flora, “I
left her lying on the grass.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you leave her
there?” inquired Alfred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought, brother, that maybe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>God would make a gourd
grow over her head, like that
which grew over Jonah.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the sun is not as hot
here as it is in Jonah’s country,”
said Alfred. “Besides, she is
not flesh and blood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some time after this, when
the weather had become cold,
Alfred had a cousin, named Rupert,
come to spend his vacation
with him. Rupert was five
years older than Alfred. He had
not lived much at home with his
parents. He had been almost
always at a public school. Alfred
had never yet been to
school.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert’s mother sent Flora a
large doll. She said,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“O, thank you, cousin! I
will name her Miriam.”
“Who is Miriam?” said Rupert;
for he had not heard of
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, cousin,” said Flora, “Miriam
was the dear little sister who
watched Moses when he lay in
the ark by the river’s side. And
it was Miriam who played beautiful
music on the timbrel, after
the children of Israel had crossed
the Red Sea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert managed to amuse
himself pretty well, for the first
few days, with skating, and
riding down hill on Alfred’s sled.
But after a little time he took a
cold, which confined him to the
house, and he began to look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>around for something to read.
Now there were quantities of
very instructive, and very amusing
books too, about the house;
but there were not fairy tales
enough to satisfy Rupert. So,
in place of reading, he began to
tell Alfred a good many of the
wonderful things that he had
heard or had read in his own
books.</p>

<p class='c007'>He said that there was once a
man who had a wonderful salve,
which, when put on a person’s
eyes, would make him see all
the silver, and gold, and diamonds,
and other precious stones
in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that true, Rupert?” asked
Alfred.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“True? No, I do not suppose
it is true.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I do not like it as well
as that story papa told me the
other day about the blind man,
on whose eyes Jesus put the eye-salve;
for that is true,” said Alfred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you another story,
then,” said Rupert, laughing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A fairy once gave a cap to a
man whose name was Fortunatus.
Whenever Fortunatus wished
to be anywhere, he had only
to put the cap upon his head, and
he was in the place where he
wished to be, in less than a minute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is not that true either?” said
Alfred.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“No; fairy tales are never
true.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not think it is as pretty
as the story of Elijah, which papa
has often told me, nor any more
wonderful either. Elijah was
taken to heaven in a fiery chariot.
There is a great deal about Elijah
in the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Rupert, “I think
you pair my stories pretty well.
See if you can match this.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was a poor woman
who had a good little girl named
May-Flower; and one day a
fairy brought May-Flower a
cow, and told her to milk it.
She milked the cow, and it gave
milk enough to fill all the dishes
and pans in the house; and yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the milk still ran, so that there
was no end of it. And that one
cow made that woman the richest
person on the island where
she lived.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred’s mamma had been
listening to Rupert’s stories.
When he stopped, she smiled
and said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think Alfred can match that
story.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How, mamma? O, I know!
Elijah went once to a poor woman,
and asked her for a piece
of bread, when there was a great
famine in the land. The woman
had only ‘a handful of meal in a
barrel, and a little oil in a cruse;’
but that handful of meal never
grew any less, or the oil either,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>until God sent rain to put an end
to the famine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Alfred, that is a match
to Rupert’s story: but do not you
recollect another miracle, which
is quite as wonderful as the story
of the cow which gave so much
milk?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred did not, at first, understand
what his mamma wanted
him to remember, until she said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did the prophet Elisha
do for the poor widow whose
husband feared God, when they
were going to make slaves of her
two sons?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, he made one pot of oil fill
all the vessels that were in the
house; and the woman sold the
oil, and paid her debts with it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>and then had enough money left
for herself and her sons to live

<p class='c007'>“Well, those <i>are</i> nice stories,”
said Rupert. “I did not know
before that there were any such
in the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Alfred said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, you haven’t heard half of
them yet. Let me show you my
picture of Samuel, and we will
get mamma to tell us about him.
I never get tired of hearing about
little Samuel and his dear, good
mother!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert looked as if he did not
care about hearing the story; but
he seemed pleased with the picture.
It was the picture of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>beautiful boy, kneeling before a
very old man, with a long beard.
The sun fell upon the boy’s curls,
and made them appear of a
golden color.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is not little Samuel pretty?”
said Alfred. “And that is grandpa
Eli. Does not he look good?
O, do mamma tell me about
him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And mamma told him the
story; and Rupert seemed to get
interested in it before she had
finished. I give it to my little
readers in the next chapter.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Penrose</span> said, “I like to
read the stories in the Bible very
slowly; and I like to think, as I
go along, how the persons of
whom I read looked, and how
their houses looked, and how
they felt when they did certain
things of which the Bible tells
us. It makes me remember the
stories better, and makes me feel
as if I had seen all that I read of.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The story of Samuel always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>appeared to me like a beautiful
picture. I seem to see the house
in which pious Hannah lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There were many pretty hills
in the land of Syria; and perhaps
her husband’s house stood on the
side of one of them. Olive-trees,
with their pale green leaves, and
dark cedars, may have shaded the
house, for they both grew in that
country; and grape-vines, bearing
sunny grapes, may have
grown over the pleasant porch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I must not indulge my
fancy too much: so I will go on
with my little story.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hannah was a good woman.
She had no children: so she
prayed to God to give her a
child. She said if God would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>do so, her child should be his as
long as he lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God heard Hannah’s prayer.
He sent her a little son, and then
she was very happy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some people make promises
to God, and then forget them.
This is wicked. Hannah did
not do so. She remembered
how she had promised God that
her little boy should be his child.
She called him Samuel; and she
took great pains to make Samuel
a good boy. She taught him
about the true God, and about
the Messiah who was to come to
redeem his people. She sung
him to sleep with holy songs.
She taught him to kneel down
and pray to the God of Israel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>when he was a very little
boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have no doubt that she told
him of all the great things that
God had done for the children
of Israel. How the waters of
the Red Sea parted, and stood
up, like high crystal walls, on
each side of them, as they walked
across on the dry land; and how
he sent them bread from heaven,
when they traveled through the
dreary wilderness, and made
plenty of pure, cool water gush
out from the burning rock, when
they were almost choked with
thirst.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little Samuel loved God.
Very young children <i>can</i> love
God. They need not wait to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>that until they have grown large,
or until they have learned a great
deal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At last Samuel became old
enough to live away from his
mother; so she took him up to
the tabernacle at Shiloh. The
tabernacle was the church in
which the Jews worshiped. In
the tabernacle lived a very good
old man. His name was Eli.
It was Eli who was to take care
of Samuel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose Hannah led her
little boy by the hand, except
when the way was rough, or
when he became tired of walking,
and then perhaps she carried
him. And maybe when it became
hot Samuel might want to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>take his little nap under some
of the shady trees that grew on
their way. As he slept, I think,
his mother sat beside him, and
almost cried to think that he was
to be with her no longer; for although
she was willing that he
should go to be a priest of the
Lord, yet it was hard for her to
part with her only one. Perhaps,
as she looked at Samuel sleeping
under the shadowing tree, she
softly said, ‘O, my darling boy,
how I shall miss you when I return
home! Your little feet will
not run after me when I go out
to pick fresh flowers. When I
go to bring water from the spring
you will not skip beside me, and
no little dimpled hands will try
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>to raise the pitcher for me then.
My house will be so lonely without
my precious boy! I shall
dream of you in the night, and
think that you are near; but,
when I try to touch you, no little
hand will be there to take hold
of mine; and when I wake in
the morning I shall never hear
my Samuel’s sweet voice saying,
‘Peace be with you, my mother.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“But though Hannah may
have thought thus while she
looked at her sleeping boy, she
never once felt that she wanted
to take back her vow. She
loved God so well that she was
glad that she had anything as
lovely as her Samuel to give him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Thus I might weep, Alfred,
if you were one day to go from
us, as a missionary, to distant
lands; but I think that I should
still be willing, and even thankful,
that you were called by God
to such a high and holy office.”</p>

      <div class='line in2'>Good little Samuel led;</div>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>Perhaps</span> Eli met Hannah at
the door of the tabernacle, and
she may have said to him,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Eli, I bring you a precious
offering. It is my only child. It
was sweet to have him with me,
for he was gentle and obedient,
and he made my house cheerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>and happy. But I promised my
little Samuel to the Lord, and
now I have come to perform my
vow.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then Eli would say,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Thou hast done well, my
daughter. The Lord bless thee,
and repay thee, because thou hast
fulfilled the vows which thy lips
did make unto him.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“At last Hannah had to leave
her little boy. It must have been
hard for Samuel to have his
mother go away from him. At
night her voice would not sing
him to sleep. When he wakened
in the darkness, and said,
‘My mother!’ she would not be
there to answer him. No more
would he sit upon her lap, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>evening hour, to hear beautiful
stories of the patriarchs and
saints, and of the great Messiah
that was to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if he said, ‘Do not go,
my mother!’ she told him that
she would love him still, and
come again to see him; and that
Eli would be a dear father unto
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps when she went away
she said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘O, Eli, be very kind to my
little boy! He is only a tender
babe. His little bed has always
been near my own. Shall he
not sleep near you at night, so
that if he is ill you may attend
to him?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the good old priest told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Hannah to be comforted; for he
would love and take care of her
boy, and teach him to be good.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i054.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c006'>“Then Hannah kissed and
blessed Samuel, and returned to
her own home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, O, how much she
thought of him on her way back
to her house! She thought of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>him when she saw flowers such
as he had picked for her on his
way to Shiloh, and which she
had put in her bosom; and when
the tree came in sight under
which he had slept, and when
she saw, gushing from the hill,
the spring of whose water she
had given Samuel to drink, and
with which she had wetted his
soft, warm hair, and cooled his
sweet; rosy face. But Hannah
heard God’s voice telling her not
to grieve for Samuel; for that he
was to be a great and holy prophet,
who should do much good
in the world, and serve the Lord
from youth to old age. Then
Hannah listened to the voice of
God, and was comforted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>Hannah</span> used to go up to the
tabernacle, once a year, to see her
dear boy. She always took him
a little coat. O, how much pleasure
she must have taken in
making that little coat! It was
of linen, and made very much
like the tunic aprons which children
wear now, only that it was
long.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Samuel must have enjoyed
his dear mother’s yearly visit very
much. I think he often went to
the door of the tabernacle, and
looked out, on the day that he
expected her. When he saw
her coming, perhaps he asked
Eli to let him run and meet her;
unless he was too busy assisting
at the altar, for it was the day of
the yearly sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Samuel lived happily in the
tabernacle. God loved him, and
those whom he loves are happy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One night, as Samuel slept
upon his little bed, a voice called
‘Samuel!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The little boy thought that
Eli called him, and he ran to the
prophet, saying,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“‘Here am I.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eli told Samuel that <i>he</i> had
not called him; and bade him go
and lie down again. He had
just done so, when again the
voice called ‘Samuel!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The little boy again jumped
from his bed, and ran to Eli,
saying,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Here am I; for thou didst
call me.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eli said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I called not, my son. Lie
down again.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then the third time did God
call to Samuel, and three times
did he go to Eli, thinking it was
he who called him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But then Eli knew that it was
God who called the child. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>told Samuel to say, when the
Lord called him again, ‘Speak,
Lord, for thy servant heareth.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“This little Samuel did. Then
the Lord told him that he was
going to punish Eli’s wicked
sons. Eli had wicked children,
although he was a good man.
He did not punish his children
when they were naughty; so
they grew up sinners against
God, and were destroyed for their
wickedness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Samuel lived to be a very
old man. When he died the
whole nation mourned for him;
for he was a great prophet in
Israel. We do not read of his
having ever done one wrong
thing during his whole life.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Now, my children,” added
Mrs. Penrose, “perhaps you may
think that Samuel was very highly
favored to have God talk with
him. But he speaks to you also.
He speaks to you in the Bible,
which tells you how you may
get to heaven. He speaks to
you by your minister and Sunday-school
teacher, every week.
He speaks to you through your
parents’ voices; and he speaks
to your heart, by his Holy Spirit,
every day of your lives.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Flora had been listening
to the story as attentively as Rupert
and Alfred, although her
bright blue eyes began to look
sleepy. She said,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Mamma, is there more about
Samuel in the Bible?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my dear, there is much
more than I have told you,” said
her mamma.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I will make haste and
learn to read,” said she, “that I
may know all that Samuel did
when he was a big man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her mamma was glad that her
little stories made Flora wish to
read the Bible for herself.</p>

      <div class='line'>He chooses Sunday for his own;</div>
      <div class='line'>And we must neither work nor play,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Every</span> morning, at the breakfast-table,
each one repeated a
text of Scripture. They selected
their texts alphabetically, each
text beginning with the same letter.
They began with A, and
went on daily with each letter
until they got through the alphabet.
Rupert did not like this.
He could not see the use of it,
he said. But the truth was, he
did not want the trouble of learning
the text.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Mr. Penrose knew that Rupert
was to be with them but a short
time, and he was anxious to
teach him something good while
he had the opportunity. He felt
sorry for the poor boy, who had
learned so little of God’s word,
and who had never been taught
to make any difference between
the sabbath and other days. Rupert
often gave Mr. and Mrs.
Penrose trouble; but they bore
it patiently, in hope of doing him
some good.</p>

<p class='c007'>One Sunday the snow lay
deep upon the ground, but there
was a good path down the hill.
Alfred set off for church with his
papa, brothers, and Rupert. It
was too cold for little Flora to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>go that day. When they got
about half way to church Rupert
found that he had left his pocket-handkerchief.
Like most careless
boys, Rupert was always
losing his pocket-handkerchief.
Instead of putting it back in his
pocket, after using it, he would
lay it by him in the chair on
which he sat, and leave it there
when he got up. Rupert’s pocket-handkerchief
was always to be
picked up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, as I have said, when he
was half way to church Rupert
had to go back for his pocket-handkerchief.
The family walked
slowly toward the church,
thinking that he would overtake
them: but he did not; and Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Penrose waited for him upon the
step. As he stood there, however,
he saw Rupert riding in a
sleigh, through a street which
crossed the one on which the
church stood, with John Strong,
a boy with whom he had formed
a great intimacy, very much
against the wishes of his uncle
and aunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sermon had commenced
when Master Rupert walked into
church, and took his seat in his
uncle’s pew, with rather a sheepish
air. As usual, after he got
there he gaped about the church,
put his head down as if composing
himself to sleep; then
jerked it up suddenly, turned
round, fidgeted on his seat, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>made everybody near him uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the hymn was sung he
turned his back to the minister,
and looked up at the choir; a
practice, by the by, which shows
as much irreverence as bad
breeding. When we sing we
should feel as much devotion as
when we pray. How can we
do this when we stand gazing at
the choir, instead of feeling the
solemn words that we are repeating?</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the benediction
was over, Rupert caught his
cap, and, leaning over to Alfred,
said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“By jingo! what a noble pair
of horses John Strong drives!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>I have had such a capital
ride!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred’s father took hold of his
hand, and did not let it go until
he got to the house; and Henry
Penrose walked beside Rupert;
so that he had no one to listen
to his praises of John Strong’s
driving, and John Strong’s horses,
of which his mind was full.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the Sunday-school,
church in the afternoon, and
reading aloud to Alfred and Flora,
from some interesting and
profitable book, Rupert had no
time for any conversation with
Alfred; and nothing had been
said to him about his conduct in
the morning. He seemed, however,
even more restless and tired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>of Sunday than usual. Mrs.
Penrose searched the house for
some book to interest him, but
could find none that he would
read.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>After</span> tea the family assembled
around a bright coal fire,
which burnt in the grate, and
threw its pleasant glow over
every object in the room. The
wind howled around the house,
and more snow was falling to
improve the already fine sleighing.
The solar lamp lighted the

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir; I am sure I do not

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Rupert</span> knew the words of the
first commandment. He answered,
“The first commandment
is, ‘Thou shalt have no
other gods before me.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said Mr. Penrose,
“this commandment forbids our
giving that worship, or love, to
any other which is due to God
alone. If we think of anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>besides God when we profess to
be thinking of him, and when we
seem to be engaged in his worship,
then we are putting other
gods before him. Now tell me,
Rupert, were you thinking much
of God when you were in church
this morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not very much,” said
Rupert, who, with all his faults,
generally spoke the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Mr. Penrose tried to
show Rupert that he had broken
the first commandment, by allowing
something besides God to
have the first place in his mind
and heart; but he did not dwell
as long upon the subject as he
wished to do, because he knew
that young people, from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>natural dislike to serious truths,
can best be instructed by a few
hints at a time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You say that you did not
think much of God, Rupert.
Will you tell me candidly what
you <i>did</i> think of?”</p>

<p class='c007'>After close questioning, Rupert
acknowledged that he had
been thinking more of John
Strong’s beautiful gray horses
than of anything else; and that
he wished that he had them.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “What is the
second commandment, Rupert?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert undertook to say it;
but could not get quite through
it, and Alfred helped him.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “It is certain that
we always worship what we love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>best; and I fear, Rupert, although
you had no graven image to worship,
your heart was going out
in idolatry after those ‘beautiful
gray horses,’ as much as the
poor Papist’s after his wooden
cross, or his image of the Virgin.
Do you not think so? Alfred,
can you tell me of another way
in which the second commandment
can be broken?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By thinking of our clothes
instead of listening to the minister,
and trying to pray to God,
when we are in church,” said Alfred,
blushing very deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, that is what I did not
do, I am sure,” said Rupert,
whose fault was certainly not
that of being too particular about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>his dress; for his clothes were
always pitched on any way, although
he was old enough to
dress himself properly if he would.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “But it is what
I knew a little boy do, when he
had his new suit of plaid clothes,
with brass buttons, on for the first
time, and two pockets in them
besides. First he looked at himself
in the buttons; then he put
his hymn-book in his pocket;
then he pulled it out.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Alfred.</i> “O, father! I know I
did that; but I was sorry for it,
and I have tried not to break the
second commandment since.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mrs. Penrose.</i> “Yes, father, I
think that we must not talk of
what is past any more.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “I spoke of it to
show Rupert in how many different
ways we can break God’s
commandments; and to let him
know that I did not consider him
the only guilty one. Now, I
am afraid you have broken two
of the commandments, Rupert.
Shall we go on with the others?”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rupert.</i> “Yes; for I am sure
I could not have broken any
more by that little sleigh-ride.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “What is the
third commandment, Rupert?”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rupert.</i> “Thou shalt not take
the name of the Lord thy God in
vain: for the Lord will not hold
him guiltless that taketh his name
in vain.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “Your first words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>after the congregation was dismissed
prove that you broke the
third commandment. Christ says,
‘Swear not at all: neither by
heaven; for it is God’s throne:
nor by the earth; for it is his
footstool: neither by Jerusalem;
for it is the city of the great
King: neither shalt thou swear
by thy head; because thou canst
not make one hair white or black.
But let your communication be,
Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever
is more than these cometh
of evil.’ Matt. v, 34-37.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, your communication
was not Yea, yea, or Nay, nay,
when you burst upon us with
‘By jingo,’ before the minister
had hardly finished the benediction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>That word was wicked,
and certainly comes under the
head of that ‘foolish talking’
which the apostle condemns.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rupert.</i> “Well, I know you
will make me out a sabbath-breaker
next. I knew I was that
myself; but I did not know that
I was doing so many other bad
things by that sleigh-ride.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “Since you
plead guilty to breaking the
fourth commandment, Rupert,
we will pass over that, and come
to the fifth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not break that. My
father and mother would not
have cared for my riding to-day,”
said Rupert, who had got the Bible
opened before him, at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>twentieth chapter of Exodus, that
he might find out what the commandments
were.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “But you are
now under our care, Rupert.
We are as parents to you while
you stay with us. You knew
that we would not like to have
you riding about the town on a
Sunday; therefore, in not honoring
us, and doing as we wish, I
think you broke the fifth commandment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time Rupert seemed
to have got quite interested in
the examination of himself; for
Mr. Penrose spoke kindly to him,
and he knew that it was out of
love to him that he thus talked
to him of his faults.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>He ran over the commandments:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Thou shalt not kill.’ I am
sure I did not do that.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “Not if you did
not get angry at the horses, or
overdrive them.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rupert.</i> “We could not get
angry at them; they are such
noble fellows, and went so free:
but they <i>were</i> all in a lather
when they got to the stable. I
cannot say they are not hurt,
but that was not my fault, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “If they were
hurt, I am afraid you will have
to bear a little of the blame; as
you were probably the cause of
the extra ride.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span><i>Rupert.</i> (Looking at the Bible,)
“‘Thou shalt not commit
adultery.’ That has nothing to
do with horses. ‘Thou shalt not
steal.’ We did not steal, at any
rate! ‘Thou’”——</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “Stop, stop! Rupert.
Not so fast. Do not skip
over the eighth commandment so
swiftly. Did Mr. Strong know
that John had his horses and
sleigh?”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rupert.</i> “No, sir, I do not
think he did. I suppose he expected
John would take them
directly to the stable, when he
left the family at church.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “Then you were
both using what belonged to another,
in a way that the owner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>would not have liked; and in
doing this you broke the eighth
commandment.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rupert.</i> “O dear, uncle! I
hope that you won’t make out
that I broke any more of the
commandments. I know that I
did not break the ninth.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “Read the ninth
commandment to me, Rupert.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rupert.</i> “‘Thou shalt not bear
false witness against thy neighbor.’
That I did not do.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “This commandment
forbids falsehood. A boy
who, like John Strong, would
drive his father’s horses on Sunday,
without permission, would
be likely to tell a falsehood to
screen himself from blame.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span><i>Rupert.</i> “He <i>did</i> say that he
meant to tell his father he took
the horses directly home from
the church.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “Then I very
much fear that your company
was the temptation to John to
take that ride, which ended in
his telling a falsehood to his father.
When we are, in any way,
knowingly the cause of another
person’s committing sin, it is the
same as if we had committed the
sin ourselves. So, my dear Rupert,
I fear you are not quite
guiltless upon the ninth commandment.
But go on with the
tenth.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rupert.</i> “‘Thou shalt not covet.’
There! Now I know you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>will bring me up with that too,
uncle; because I said I wished I
had John’s grays. I do think
that I broke that. But just to
think that in less than an hour I
broke almost all the commandments!”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mr. Penrose.</i> “You see by
this that the breaking of one
commandment leads to the breach
of many. We rarely ever break
one commandment alone. As
St. James says, ‘Whosoever
shall keep the whole law, and
yet offend in one point, he is
guilty of all.’ James ii, 10.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rupert.</i> “Well, I do not believe
any person ever kept all the
commandments, or ever could
keep them either.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>No</span> mere man ever lived
without having broken God’s
commandments,” said Mr. Penrose.
“Jesus Christ, who was
both God and man, is the only
person who ever lived in our
world without breaking that law
which was given upon Mount
Sinai.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But must we always break
God’s commandments, papa?”
asked little Alfred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When we believe on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Lord Jesus Christ, and love him,
then he takes away our naughty
feelings, and enables us to do his
will. Do you remember that
very cold day when I was taken
ill, and your mamma had no one
but you to send for the doctor?
The snow lay deep upon the
ground; but you did not mind
that or the cold north wind either.
You loved your father so well,
that it was no hardship for you
to run half a mile through the
cold for him. But if you had
not wanted me to get well, I
know that you would have drawn
up your little face, and said, ‘O,
mamma! must I go?’ especially
as you were very happy, playing
with your blocks and your toy-sled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>when she asked you if you
thought you could take such a
long, cold walk for dear papa.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just so it becomes easy for
us to keep God’s commandments
when we learn to love him.
When we are made new creatures
in Christ Jesus we feel as
the loving child does toward his
dear father and mother. You
know that a child who loves his
parents cannot bear to do anything
to displease them. He is
always inquiring what he shall
do for the dear father whom he
loves, and who is so very good
to him. Just so the Christian
feels. He asks God, for his dear
Son’s sake, to teach him what his
will is, and to enable him to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>it; and God hears and answers
his prayer. Thus Jesus said,
‘If a man love me, he will keep
my words: and my Father will
love him, and we will come unto
him, and make our abode with
him.’ John xiv, 23.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Penrose then told Rupert
where he must go for pardon,
even to the Lord Jesus Christ,
“who ever liveth to make intercession
for us.” He did not
usually talk to the children upon
religious things for as long a
time together as he had that
evening: but Rupert was to
leave them for school in a few
days, and Mr. Penrose wanted to
give him as much instruction as
he could bear; hoping that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>might think of his words at some
future time, although he did not
care much for them now.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rupert left Norwood at the
appointed time; and we will
now turn to our little Alfred,
who continued to have pleasant
sled-rides, fine skatings, and nice
talks with papa.</p>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>Come</span>, Alfred, it is time to go
to bed,” said Mrs. Penrose to her
little son, one evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred was busy making pictures
on a slate, and did not want
to go to bed yet. He begged that
he might finish off his horse. His
mamma said he <i>might</i> finish his
horse, although his hour for going
to bed <i>had</i> come.</p>

<p class='c007'>Because he was allowed to sit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>up a little later than usual on that
evening, Alfred wanted to do so
at another time. When his mamma
said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alfred, take the lamp, and
go into the bed-room,” he would
hesitate and linger, as if he only
obeyed his mamma because he
was obliged, and not because he
loved to.</p>

<p class='c007'>One morning Alfred’s mamma
said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid my little boy has
forgotten his old text, ‘Children,
obey your parents.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, mamma,” said Alfred,
“I think I do always obey
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you do not obey me directly;
and you do not always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>seem to like to do what I tell
you. When I call you to me,
you do not run quickly. And
lately, when I have told you to
go to bed, you draw up your
face, and behave as if you went
because you must, and not because
you loved to do what your
mother desires. Now that is not
the way that God would have
little children behave. He tells
them to honor their parents.
Children should always obey
willingly, and not stop to ask for
a reason, when they are commanded
to do anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Alfred’s papa, who had
been reading in the room, but
who had heard what mamma
had said to Alfred, said,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“I will tell you a story, Alfred,
which I read when I was a very
little boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, papa!” said Alfred, “did
you use to read stories when you
were a little boy, and did you
like to have stories told you as I
do now, and did you have a
good papa to tell them to you, as
I have? Or perhaps your mamma
told them to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You ask a great many questions
in a breath, my little boy,”
said his father; “but I will try
to answer them. I did love to
read stories when I was a little
boy, and I did like to have them
told to me; but my papa was
always too busy to tell me stories,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and my mamma was dead;
so I had no one to tell me stories,
as you have.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred stood still a moment, as
if he were thinking. Then he
said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, papa, it must be very sad
not to have a mamma! Did you
never see your mother? Were
you a little baby when she
died?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then his papa told Alfred that
he was not a little baby when
his mother died; but that he was
only five years old.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I only remember one thing
about her,” said he. “I went
into her bed-room one morning,
and said, ‘Mamma, will you go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>down stairs now?’ And she answered
me, ‘In a few minutes,
Arthur. Go and stand by the
window until I am ready.’ Then
as I stood by the window I
saw my mamma kneel down by
the side of her bed, and put her
hands over her face. When she
was done I asked her what made
her cry? She answered, ‘I was
not crying, my child. I was
praying to God.’ That is almost
all I recollect of my dear
mamma, Alfred.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think that was a pleasant
remembrance, papa,” said little
Alfred. “Perhaps your mamma
then prayed for you, and
maybe that is the reason why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>you are good now. But please
tell me the story that you read
when you were a little boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Alfred’s papa told him
the little story, which you will
find in the next chapter.</p>

</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The poor hen did cry,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And make a loud din.</div>
      <div class='line'>And hard did she strive</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To teach them aright;</div>
      <div class='line'>For to see them do wrong</div>

      <div class='c008'><span class='sc'>Flowers for Children.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>There</span> was once a hen that
had five chickens. They were
all very pretty. Four of them
were white. One of them was
of a reddish brown.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The hen and chickens belonged
to a little boy, named James.
One day James heard the hen
and chickens make a great noise.
He was planing some boards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>with his little plane, to make a
bird-house; but he dropped his
plane, and ran out into the yard.
The old hen was calling her little
ones to come under her wings.
She had seen a large, fierce-looking
dog come into the yard, and
she was frightened for her chickens.
She said, ‘Cluck! cluck!
cluck!’ very quickly; and the
chickens seemed to know that
she called them to her, for they
all, except one, ran very quickly,
and hid themselves under her
wings. One little white chicken
looked up at its mother, as if she
said, ‘I will come directly, mother;
but not quite yet:’ and
then went on picking up seeds
with her little bill.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“The poor mother called louder.
James ran to drive away the
dog; but he sprang forward,
caught the little white chicken in
his mouth, and ran out of the
yard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now the poor chicken was
lost for not minding its mother
immediately; and great harm
may come to little children from
the same cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If children are not obedient
to their parents they will not do
well here; but, what is worse,
disobedience will be punished in
another world. It is said of him
who does not honor his father
and his mother that ‘his lamp
shall be put out in obscure darkness.’”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>After this Alfred was very careful,
for some time, to do everything
that he was told, immediately.
It was pleasant to see
him jump the instant he was
called, and make his little feet fly
rapidly along to do what he was
bid. He did not say any more,
“Mamma, I am not sleepy;”
“O, please, mamma, let me sit
up a little longer! why must I
go to bed so early?” when his
mamma said, “Alfred, it is your
bed-time;” but he would take the
lamp in his hand, and say, “Good
night” to all the family, and go
to bed with a pleasant smile upon
his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day after his father had
told him the story of the disobedient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>chicken, Alfred said to his
mother,</p>

<p class='c007'>“When papa was telling me
that story yesterday it made me
think of the pretty words that Jesus
said when he came nigh unto
Jerusalem, and wept over it.
Won’t you read them to me,

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>We</span> closed our last chapter
with a beautiful verse from the
Bible; and when she had read
it, Alfred’s mamma said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“How full of love was our
dear Saviour when he lived upon
the earth! He pitied the poor
wicked people who despised him,
and who at length put him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>death. And now that he is in
heaven, at the right hand of God
the Father, he yet pities the poor
sinner who will not come unto
him and obtain eternal life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, Alfred! I hope that you
will not make Jesus sorry, as the
Jews did! You must love him,
my dear child. You must think
of all his goodness. You must
pray to him very often, and try
to please him in all things. Then
you will be his dear little boy.
He will take care of you as long
as you live; and, when you die,
he will take you to heaven, to
dwell with him for ever and
ever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, mamma!” said little Alfred,
“I do want to be God’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>dear child. I do not love wicked
people who swear, and get drunk,
and break the sabbath.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I dare say not, Alfred.
But those who swear, and get
drunk, and break the sabbath, are
not the only wicked people.
There are some, who would not
do any of these things for the
world, who yet are not good in
the sight of God. He sees their
hearts, and he knows that they
do not love him. They do not
think of him. They love many
things better than God.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Alfred.</i> “But it is so wicked,
mamma, to love anything better
than God!”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mamma.</i> “Yet how many do
this, Alfred! How few little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>boys there are who think constantly
of God, even when they
are in church, or while they are
saying their prayers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred, who sometimes boasted
how good he was, although he
had often been told what a wicked
and deceitful heart he had by
nature, and how necessary it was
that it should be washed in the
blood of Jesus, said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma, I think of God when
I go to church, and whenever I
say my prayers.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mamma.</i> “I wonder then that
you should have looked so long
at those new boots, in church,
last Sunday, my dear. I was
quite sorry and ashamed to see
you hold out your feet, and look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>at them so many times. Then
you would pull the straps, and
turn your foot round and round,
that you might see the boots all
over: and I do not believe that
you heard a word of the sermon
all the time. O, my dear Alfred,
you thought more of your boots
than of God!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred hung his head, and said
he was sorry that he had done
so; and that he would pray to
God to forgive him for Jesus’
sake. He asked his mamma to
pray that he might love God
more, and try to do his will, not
only on Sundays, but every day
and all day long.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A very</span> few days after Alfred’s
talk with his papa about obeying
immediately, Mr. Penrose met a
gentleman who told him about a
little son of his, whose life was
probably saved by his quickly
obeying his father. The story
was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The little boy, and his father
and mother, were sailing upon a
canal. A canal is a very deep
and wide ditch, full of water, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>which boats sail. Many bridges
are built over these canals. Persons
have been killed by not lying
down flat upon the deck of
the canal-boat in time to prevent
their being struck by the bridges.
But grown people generally look
out for them in time to save
themselves, when they stand
upon the deck of the boat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Edward had been taken
from his parents by some of the
passengers, and carried up to the
deck. He was then about six
years old. After awhile his father
and mother also went up.
As soon as they reached the deck
they saw the boat was going very
rapidly toward a bridge; and O
how frightened they were to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>their dear little boy standing alone
on that part of the boat which
was nearest to it! There was
no time to run and catch him in
their arms. The father could only
speak to him, and his mother
stood trembling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Edward’s father called
very loudly to him, “Edward!
lie down!” and the dear little fellow
was so accustomed to obey
in a minute that he dropped down
upon the deck as soon as his father
spoke to him. In this way
his life was saved. If Edward
had stopped to say, “Why must
I lie down, father?” he would
probably have been killed. It is
promised to those who keep their
Father’s commandments, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>they shall have “length of days,
long life, and peace.” Proverbs
iii, 2.</p>

<p class='c007'>This story delighted Alfred,
and afterward, when he was bidden
to do anything, his mamma
had only to say, “Alfred, remember
Edward,” to make him run
very quickly and do what he was
told to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>His father told him the name
of the book, and Frank said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, how dry it looks! I wonder
you can bear to read such
very dry books, father!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The book is very interesting
to me, Frank,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I like to read travels, and stories
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>of all kinds; stories about the
sea and the land,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God knew that children loved
stories,” said his papa; “and he
has filled his own book with the
most wonderful and beautiful
stories.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and travels and voyages
too, papa,” said Alfred. “Was
not that a fine voyage of Paul;
and a wonderful journey which
the Israelites took through the
wilderness?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O yes!” said little Flora;
“with a bright pillar going on
before them at night, and a
cloudy pillar all day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And bread sent down from
heaven for them to eat,” said Alfred.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“And cool water gushing out
of the rock,” continued little Flora.
“And, O, how pretty the
story of the Shunamite’s little boy
is, who got sick, and said, ‘My
head! my head!’ I am glad
Elisha made him alive again.”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/i114.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c006'>“And, O, Flora,” said Alfred,
“all about Elijah is so pretty!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Don’t you remember how the
ravens fed him in the wilderness?
Was not that a wonderful story,
father?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my son,” said Alfred’s
papa, “it was very wonderful:
and I read a story yesterday that
was something like it, although
it was not in the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear father,” said Alfred,
“will you tell it to me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, if you will bring your
chair beside me, and sit very still.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was once a good man
named Pierre Merlin. He was
a pious minister; and the Roman
Catholics hated him, because
he preached doctrines
which the Bible teaches, but
which they do not like.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“At one time, the Roman
Catholics, in France, determined
to murder all who did not belong
to their church. They <i>did</i> murder
many hundred pious persons,
on a night which was called
St. Bartholomew’s Eve. They
would have killed good Pierre
Merlin, but he jumped out of a
window, and thus got away from
those wicked people. It was
dark, and he ran on, on, on;
expecting every minute to be
caught. Then he came to a hay-stack.
Quite out of breath, he
hid himself in this friendly place,
which seemed set there to be to
him what the city of refuge was
to the Israelites, when they ran
for their life. He thanked God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>for his mercy to him. He could
not lie down in that narrow place,
and he was very tired; yet, nestled
in the hay, he slept in peace,
for the Lord sustained him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The morning came, gray,
still, and misty. The little birds
began to twitter, and the poultry
around awoke, and shook their
wings, and smoothed their feathers,
and sent out their long,
loud cry of welcome to the opening
day. Then golden colors
painted the eastern sky; and, at
last, the bright, red sun rose to
spread his gracious rays over the
awakening earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pierre Merlin gladly, yet sorrowfully,
looked at the sun.
Since it had last risen many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>God’s dear saints had been cruelly
murdered. Some of his own
friends were among the number.
This thought made him
weep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think, my dear children,
that Merlin wished any evil
to those people who had been so
cruel to him, and to his friends?
No, for he was a Christian. Like
Jesus, he said, ‘Father, forgive
them! They know not what
they do.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I said that <i>gladly</i>, as well as
sorrowfully, this good minister
looked at the sun. Though he
was sorry for the wickedness of
his enemies, and for the death of
his friends, he was yet glad that
his life was saved. He thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>that he might yet preach the gospel
of Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He knew that his enemies
were all around, looking for him;
for he had heard his name mentioned
by them with loud curses.
He dared not venture from his
hiding-place; although, as the
morning advanced, he became
faint and hungry. He thought
he should perish with hunger if
he remained there many days.
But he continued praying to God,
and did not fail to put his trust in
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After he had prayed, he felt
something moving near him.
Merlin’s heart beat very quickly.
What could it be? Was it a
hand thrust in among the hay, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>feel if he was there? He lay
very still. Still the motion continued.
Directly he heard a
sound: it was the voice of a hen
that said, ‘Cack, cack, cack!’
very joyfully, because she had
just laid an egg.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then the hen went away;
and Merlin put out his hand, and
took the egg which she had left,
and ate it for his breakfast. O,
he did not want egg-glass or
spoon, or even salt, to make that
egg taste deliciously! He felt
stronger for eating it. ‘But what
shall I do to-morrow?’ said he to
himself. Then came this text to
Merlin’s mind: ‘Behold the fowls
of the air: for they sow not, neither
do they reap, nor gather into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>barns; yet your heavenly Father
feedeth them. Are ye not much
better than they?’ Matt. vi, 26.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So he determined to trust in
God for the morrow; in the gracious
Father who feeds the little
birds that cannot do anything
toward making food grow for
themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God did not forget his child.
He saw Merlin in the hay-stack
just as plainly as he saw Elijah
in the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The second day came; and
the old hen came too, laid her
egg in the hay-stack, and walked
off. Merlin thus got his breakfast
on the second day. It was
not much, but it gave him some
strength.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“The third day his good old
friend again paid him a visit. O,
how very anxiously he had watched
for her that morning! How
afraid he was that she would not
come! Faint and hungry as he
had become, it tasted even more
deliciously than the two former
ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On the third day all was still
around him. He made a little
hole in the straw, and peeped out.
He saw nobody. Night came
on, and Merlin left his hiding-place,
praying to God every minute,
as he walked along.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is that he sees in the
distance? It is one of the cruel
soldiers, with his gun! But he
must go on. He fears to turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>back. As he comes nearer he
finds it is only a small tree, with
a very long arm, which had
frightened him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Onward he goes, stumbling
in the darkness, and very weary.
The morning comes. What is
that before him? A river, gleaming,
like molten silver, in the
early light. And, O joyful sight!
a vessel, bearing English colors,
just setting sail. Merlin makes
a signal. A boat is let down
from the vessel. He is taken in
it, and escapes safely to England
to tell the story of his wonderful
preservation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Alfred</span> began to read pretty
well by the time he was five
years old. He and his papa
would read a chapter in the Bible
together, verse by verse, once
a day. Then, when his papa
had time, he would talk a little
to his son about what they had
read.</p>

<p class='c007'>The month of March had
come, and brought with it many
signs of spring. The blue-bird
and the robin had been heard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and wild-flowers bloomed in
warm and sunny nooks. The
willow showed its silvery balls,
and the sun was high in the
heavens.</p>

<p class='c007'>One sunny day, when the
snow had melted, and the roads
were a little dried, Mr. Penrose
took his little boy to walk in the
woods. They found some beautiful
green moss, and one bunch
of arbutus. Alfred brought the
flower to his mamma, and put
the moss around her flower-pots.
Then, when they had rested, he
sat down to read his chapter with
his father.</p>

<p class='c007'>They read the seventh chapter
of Matthew, which tells of the
man whose house the floods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>swept away, because it was built
upon the sand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is meant by the foolish
man, Alfred?” said his papa.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it the wicked man, papa?”
asked the little boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it is the sinner, who
does not love the Saviour. Jesus
Christ is the only hope of the
soul. I know I often tell you
this; but I do it because I want
you always to remember this
great truth. Jesus here compares
himself to a rock. When we
learn to love the Saviour as we
ought, then we are set upon this
rock; and God will not let sorrow,
or even death, remove us
from that safe resting-place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Last summer I saw something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>which made me think of
what we have just read.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It had rained hard in the
night, but cleared off early in the
morning. The sun was very hot.
About ten o’clock I saw quite a
smoke arise from the flat, tin roof
of the wing of the house. I looked,
and found it covered with
water. I wondered what it could
mean. Upon examination, I
found a bird’s nest, very neatly
made of hair, and lined with feathers,
placed directly over the hole
which led into the spout. It
filled it up entirely, and so prevented
the water running into the
spout.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor foolish bird, to take so
much pains to build its nest in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>that insecure place! She had
thought, I suppose, that she
would keep house very snugly
there; and there bring up her
little ones, and give them their
first lesson in flying from the
house to the big willow-tree,
which stands alongside of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How frightened she must
have been when she felt the waters
overflowing her nest! How
much she must have wished that
she had put it in the right place!
My dear boy, we must make a
better provision for our heavenly
home than this poor bird did for
her nest; so that we may not be
surprised and disappointed, like
her, at last.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>One</span> day, when Alfred was
at church, the minister preached
from the words, “I say unto you,
there is joy in the presence of the
angels of God over one sinner
that repenteth.” Luke xv, 10. It
is a sweet text; and the minister
preached a beautiful sermon upon
it. Alfred’s mamma showed him
the words in the Bible; and he
remembered them, and told them
to his papa, who was ill that day,
and could not go to church. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Penrose talked to Alfred about
the words he had repeated to
him, and the next day told him
about a family which rejoiced
over the lost ones who wandered
from their home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had two little cousins who
lived in New-York,” said Alfred’s
papa. “Harry was six
years old, and little Ann five.
They had two brothers, and one
sister. They were never allowed
to go into the street without some
person with them. This they
did not like; so they often tried
to open the front door, but the
latch was too high and too strong
for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One morning they went into
the entry, before their papa and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>mamma had come down stairs.
While they were playing there
the milkman rang at the door.
The servant went to get a pitcher
for the milk, and left the front
door open. When Harry saw
this he said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Ann, let’s go down on the
pavement, and take a little walk.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ann said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘O, yes, Harry, do let us
go!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“So they walked out of the
door, and down the steps to the
pavement. Then they felt very
proud. They were pleased to
think how nicely they had run
away. They had no cloak or
shawl, although the day was cool,
for it was the fall of the year.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Harry wore a little cap, and Ann
a bonnet, which they caught from
behind the door, as they went
out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They walked on through the
streets, looking at all the pretty
things that they saw in the shop-windows.
After they had gone
on some time, little Ann said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Brother, I am hungry.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Harry said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I am hungry too. We will
go home, and get our breakfast.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“But this was not easily done.
They turned back; but they did
not take the right street to lead
them home. Every step took
them further off. So on they
went, hand in hand, like the
babes in the wood, until they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>both grew still more hungry and
faint. They sat down upon
some steps to rest, and then got
up, and wandered on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After awhile they found that
they were near a river, and they
saw a boat lying by the wharf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Harry said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Ann, I think that boat will
take us to grandpapa’s. We always
sail on the river when we
go to see him. Let us step into
it; and when we get to Newark
grandmamma will give us some
breakfast.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The tears were running fast
down poor little Ann’s purple
cheeks; for she was not only
hungry, but tired and sorry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She said,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“‘But won’t mamma be angry?
O, I want to see mamma!’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then Harry was very naughty.
He shook his little sister, and
pulled her, to make her step upon
the boat. She drew back, and
Harry slipped, and fell between
the wharf and the boat into the
water. Ann was dreadfully frightened,
and screamed. She thought
her brother would be drowned.”</p>

</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O joy! I see our mother’s face,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Our own delightful home;</div>
      <div class='line'>And never more from it shall we,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Dear Annie, want to roam.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“<span class='sc'>In</span> our last conversation we
left Harry struggling in the water,
and Ann standing on the
wharf, screaming and crying very
loud.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just then, a young man, who
wore a short blue jacket, a checked
shirt, and a shining hat on the
back of his head, came along;
and, seeing Ann’s distress and
poor Harry’s situation, without
saying one word, pulled off his
jacket, and jumped into the water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>after him. By this time a
good many other people had gathered
around. The sailor soon
came up, with Harry in his arms;
but the little boy was very pale
and cold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some people carried them
into a small house that smelt of
rum and tobacco smoke. They
asked the children their names,
and where they lived. When
they had told them, they said
they should be sent home after
awhile, but that Harry must first
go to bed; for he shivered, and
was still very cold. They wanted
him to drink some rum, but
he refused. So they carried him
up into a little, dark room, and
laid him in a dirty bed, and put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>some very heavy covering over
him; and then went to get the
children something to eat. Little
Ann staid alongside of her brother’s
bed, crying all the time.
Soon the woman of the house
came up stairs, bringing them
some bread and butter, and
crackers and cheese. But, although
they had been so hungry
before, they did not feel like eating
then. They were sick and
unhappy. It seemed to them as
if they were a great way off from
their own home. The people in
whose house they were, were not
at all like their dear papa and
mamma. They talked very loud,
and laughed a great deal, and
used words which the children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>had never heard before. Ann
said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Brother, we have been very
wicked in going away from home.
I am afraid we never shall see
our dear papa and mamma any
more.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then they put their arms
around each other’s neck, and
cried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just then the woman of the
house came in, and again asked
them the name and the number
of the street in which they lived.
This Harry remembered, and told
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Well, don’t take on so. I
am busy fixing my Ned off to
sea now; but to-night I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>take you to the place where your
father and mother live.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The children thought it would
be a very long time before night
would come. Ann crept into the
bed with Harry; and they nestled
up to each other, and fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“While they slept, a sound
was heard without: ‘Lost children!
Lost children!’ This was
called out by a man who, at the
same time, rang a bell which he
held in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When he got near the sailor,
he was told that the children
were safe in the house. He
stopped ringing his bell, and
went, in great haste, to tell the
parents of the children that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>were found. Soon the father
came, in a carriage, to take his
little runaways home. The children
awaked from their sleep in
that miserable room to see their
dear father’s loving face bending
over them, and to feel his warm
kisses on their lips and cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was dark when they got
home. As they were taken from
the carriage, they saw each window
in the brightly lighted parlor
filled with faces on the look-out
for them. And, O, what joy,
when they found themselves
again in their cheerful, happy
home; in their precious mother’s
arms!</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was time for Willy and
Charlie to have their supper, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>for their little baby-sister to be
put to bed; but nobody thought
of them. Every one was thinking
of the little ones who had
been lost, but were now found.
Parents and servants rejoiced together
over the little stray lambs.
They had been in danger, but
were now safe. They had wandered
from their father’s house;
and he had sent a messenger to
find them. They had been
naughty; but their father forgave
them, and rejoiced over them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred knew enough of the
Bible to apply this story. He
saw in Harry and Ann’s kind father
a picture of our dear heavenly
Parent, who sent his Son
to call us back to him; and who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>kindly receives and freely forgives
us when we return. The
rejoicing household, who forgot
the other little ones for joy that
Harry and Ann were safe, reminded
him of the holy angels,
who are so glad when a wicked
person becomes good.</p>

</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Frank had two pretty little dogs,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With hair as soft as silk,</div>
      <div class='line'>A few brown spots upon their back,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The rest as white as milk.</div>
      <div class='line'>And many a happy hour they had,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In dull or shining weather;</div>
      <div class='line'>For, in the house, or in the fields,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They always were together.</div>
      <div class='line'>It was rare fun to see them race</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Through fields of bright-red clover,</div>
      <div class='line'>And jump across the running brooks,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Flush and his brother Rover.</div>
      <div class='c008'><span class='sc'>Mrs. Child.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Alfred</span>, with all his brothers
and sisters, had been taught to
tell the exact truth. They had
learned many texts of Scripture
which speak of the sin and punishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of lying. These are a
few of them:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The mouth of them that
speak lies shall be stopped.” Psa.
lxiii, 11.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The lip of truth shall be
established for ever: but a lying
tongue is but for a moment.”
Prov. xii, 19.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All liars shall have their part
in the lake which burneth with
fire and brimstone.” Rev. xxi, 8.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred’s brother Frank had two
very beautiful young dogs. They
had been given him by a friend,
and were of a scarce and valuable
breed. One of the dogs he had
named Flush, and the other Rover.
They had brown, silken
ears, and brown spots on their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>backs and legs. They had just
been taken from their mother
when Frank brought them home
in his arms. They mourned a
little; and Alfred and Flora felt
sorry for them. They thought
that they cried for their mother;
and I suppose they did.
Frank fed them with some
warm milk. Then he let Alfred
and Flora stroke them. After
they had been fed they lay down
very quietly, and went to sleep.
It was time for Frank to go to
school: so he said to Alfred and
Flora,</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must not touch my little
dogs while I am at school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Flora said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, brother, I will not.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>But Alfred said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“May I not put them in my
apron, very softly? I will not
hurt them; for I love them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His brother said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I am at home I will
let you play with the little dogs;
but you must promise me not to
touch my dogs while I am at
school. They are very tender;
and if you were not to lift them
in just the right way, you would
hurt, and perhaps kill them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred then said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Frank, I will not touch the
pretty little things when you are
away; but you will let me pat
them when you are at home,
won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; you may play with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>them, and pat them, when I am
here; and then you may feed
them sometimes, too; but you
will certainly remember your
promise when I am away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some days after this, when
Frank was at school, Alfred’s
mamma heard him say,</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, pretty little fellows! nice
little fellows! I love you very
much, little Flush and little Rover!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred’s mamma stepped into
the hall to see what her little boy
was doing. He was standing by
the steps of the kitchen door;
and the dogs were trying to climb
into the house. But when they
had put their paws upon the step
they would fall backward; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>they were too small to climb up.
Alfred would stretch out his
hand to help the little dogs; and
then he would draw it back again
when he remembered his promise
to his brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little colored boy was rubbing
his knives in the kitchen,
and he said to Alfred,</p>

<p class='c007'>“The dogs want to get up the
steps. My hands are all brick-dust.
Take hold, and help them
up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Alfred said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, I must not touch them,
John; for I promised I would
not. I wish I <i>could</i> lift the little
things up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It made Alfred’s mamma glad
to find how well her dear boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>kept his word. She lifted the
dogs into the kitchen; and they
seemed happy and well satisfied,
for they laid down close together,
behind the door, and went fast
asleep.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And some of the fruit-trees that grew in the</div>
      <div class='line'>garden shot their branches over the wall; and</div>
      <div class='line'>they that found them did gather them up, and</div>
      <div class='line'>eat of them to their hurt. So Christiana’s boys</div>
      <div class='line'>(as boys are apt to do) being pleased with the</div>
      <div class='line'>trees, and with the fruit that did hang thereon,</div>
      <div class='line'>did pluck them, and began to eat. Their mother</div>
      <div class='line'>did also chide them for so doing.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Soon</span> after this Mrs. Penrose
went to New-York, and took Alfred
and Flora with her. There
they saw many beautiful things.
As they rode up from the wharf,
they were continually calling out,
“O, mamma, look at that window!”
or, “O, mamma, see that
picture!” and, “O, what is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>high building?” and, “Who is
that queer-looking person?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Their mamma shook her head,
and said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Children, try to be quiet.
Look as much as you like, but
do not ask me any questions
now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The carriage rattled over the
pavement, and there were so
many other noises around, that
she could not hear their questions.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they stopped at the
house of the friend with whom
they were to stay, they saw much
that was very beautiful. There
were pictures and vases, and
many things that they had never
seen or thought of in their little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>simple country home. But Alfred
thought that nothing in the
house was as pretty as what he
saw from the back windows. It
was a garden, filled with flowers.
He was delighted when he was
told that he might spend as much
time there as he liked. Alfred
was a real little country boy, and
he loved flowers dearly. In this
garden were purple and white
petunias, and roses of many
shades, and of different colors.
Sweet mignionette, too, grew
there; and there was the delicate
cypress-vine, with its feathery
stalk, and its little bright flower.
There were grape-vines too, which
climbed a trellice that leaned
against the high brick wall. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the vines hung grapes; but they
were still quite green and hard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred’s mamma told him that
he might walk in this garden;
but that he must never pick any
of the flowers, or the grapes.
She thought that she might trust
the little boy, who kept his word
so well about the dogs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some days after this, when
Flora was taking her nap, Alfred’s
mamma wanted him for
something; and, from the garden
door, called him to come to
her. While she waited, she saw
him coming toward her, with his
little mouth puckered up, as if
he had something in it. She
called,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come here, Alfred.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>And Alfred came up the steps
very slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have you got in your
mouth, my dear?” said Alfred’s
mamma.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not one word did Alfred answer;
but he looked down, and
turned very red. His mother
knew, from his looks, that he had
been doing something that was
not right. He did not have that
bright, happy face which he usually
wore.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred’s mother said to him,</p>

<p class='c007'>“My son, open your mouth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Alfred opened his
mouth, O, how sorry I am to
tell it of him! he showed a large
green grape, tucked away in the
corner of his mouth, which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>put into his hand as quickly as
possible. His mamma took the
grape out of Alfred’s hand, and
led him up stairs into her bed-room.
She said to him,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alfred, how many of those
grapes have you eaten?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just one besides this, mamma,”
said he, crying very much.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you eat them, Alfred?”
said his mother. “Did
not I tell you that you must not
do so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, mamma; but they looked
so very good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear little boy, that was
the reason that Eve ate the apple
which made us all sinners. She
thought it looked good. It ‘was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>pleasant to the sight.’ Did you
not tell me, the other day, that
you thought Eve was very
naughty to eat the apple; and
that you would not have done as
she did? But you see you have
done just like her. She disobeyed
God by eating the apple, and
you have disobeyed him by eating
that green grape.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Alfred.</i> “Mamma, God did
not tell me that I must not eat
the grape.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mamma.</i> “Yes, Alfred, he told
you so through me; for it is for
me to tell you what the will of
God is: and you did not follow
God’s commandment to ‘obey
your parents’ when you ate that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>green grape. I did not see you
eat it, but God did; and God
does not love little boys, you
know very well, who disobey
their parents.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred continued to cry, and
said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, I am so sorry, mamma!”</p>

<p class='c007'>His mamma told him to go
into his room, and stay there by
himself, that he might think over
what a naughty boy he had been.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred went; and when his
mamma followed him, some time
afterward, he came to her, and
said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma, I was very wicked,
I know. But I have prayed to
God to forgive me, because Jesus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Christ died. Don’t you
think he will, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c007'>His mother said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my dear, I have no
doubt that he will forgive you, if
you are sorry for your sin, and
are determined never again to do
such a naughty thing. God has
forgiven us all a great many sins;
and he is still gracious and merciful.
It is written, ‘Let the
wicked forsake his way, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts:
and let him return unto the Lord,
and he will have mercy upon
him; and to our God, for he will
abundantly pardon.’ Isa. lv, 7.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From that time, I am glad to
be able to say, little Alfred always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>told the truth; and would
never stop to look at anything
that he had been told not to
touch; but hasten from it, that
he might not be tempted to do
as he had done about the grapes.</p>

      <div class='line'>Now I saw in my dream, that by this time</div>

      <div class='line'>whose air was very sweet and pleasant, the way</div>
      <div class='line'>lying directly through it, they solaced themselves</div>
      <div class='line'>there for a season. Yea, here they heard continually</div>
      <div class='line'>the singing of birds, and saw every day</div>
      <div class='line'>the flowers appear in the earth, and heard the</div>
      <div class='line'>voice of the turtle in the land. In this country</div>
      <div class='line'>the sun shineth night and day.... Here they</div>
      <div class='line'>were within sight of the city they were going</div>

      <div class='line'>thereof: for in this land the shining ones commonly</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Alfred</span> and Flora, soon after
this, went with their mamma to
a very delightful place. You
must read the lines from the Pilgrim’s
Progress which I have put
over the chapter; for the land of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Beulah, which they speak of, was
very much like the spot they
visited. The kind friends with
whom they staid loved God; and
there were bright flowers, and
pleasant fruits, and blue hills,
and a wide, clear river, and a
dear little boy for Alfred to play
with. Alfred was very happy,
running through the garden and
orchard, and swinging in the
nice swing, and going to school
with little Walter. They went
to school to a lady who loved
them, and taught them many
good things.</p>

<p class='c007'>My dear little readers, I wish
you all to see the pretty school-house
to which they went every
morning and afternoon. So get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>your caps, for the sun is hot, and
stand by me on this large piazza,
from which we have so fine a
view of the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is nine o’clock, and Alfred
and Walter come running out of
the house. They turn to the
right upon the gravel walk which
leads to the river. They take the
longest way, because the walk is
so pleasant.</p>

<p class='c007'>How the river sparkles in the
sunshine this clear morning! O,
how many boats we see! One,
two, three, four. The boys get
tired of counting them, there are
so many.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id018'>
<img src='images/i163.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c006'>Now a steam-boat, with many
people on its deck, rushes swiftly
past. Alfred and Walter stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>by the swing on the Catalpa-tree,
to look at the steam-boat. Then
they must sit down, just one half
minute, on that pretty covered
bench, standing between two
trees. But they will not sit long.
They must not keep Miss Lee
waiting; and she calls them from
the school-house door. Round
the lawn they fly, past that large
elm, and the plum-tree, bent
down with green gages. They
have come to the school-house,
which well deserves a separate
chapter.</p>

      <div class='line'>Come, dear ones, to your lessons,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>You have so much to say,</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>O, what</span> a pleasant place that
school-house was! How happily
did Alfred, and Walter, and little
Sidney, pass their time there;
taught so well and so kindly by
good Miss Lee!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>There it stands, down in a little
dingle, with its deep roof and
carved border, and its green latticed
windows. It is shaded by
a large elm,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“which, with looks of love,</div>
      <div class='line'>Spreads its whispering leaves above,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through long summer hours.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>A cherry-tree stands by the door.
White and blue pigeons sit upon
the roof, and coo. The little
boys smell the sweet flowers in
the garden, as they study their
books. All kinds of sweet flowers
grow in that charming garden,
alongside of the school-house.
There are whole beds of the heliotrope,
the ever-sweet heliotrope,
with its gray, crimped leaves, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>its yellow heart. Lovely mignionette,
too, is hiding itself
everywhere. Although you do
not see this modest flower, whose
pretty French name means little
darling, yet you smell its sweetness
continually. There are
white, and pink, and deep red
roses, in full bloom; and verbenas,
pink, crimson, blue, white,
and purple; and the snow-white
day-lily, which smells like fresh,
ripe grapes. And near the little
school-house is the prettiest
bower, made entirely of the cypress-vine.
It looks as fine and
delicate as lace-work, yet its
stalks are so thickly woven that
it will not blow down.</p>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>In front of the school-house is
a green lawn. When the boys
stood upon it they saw the river,
and the hills on the other side,
and the noble Catskill Mountains,
as blue as the sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this beautiful little place the
boys spent some hours every day.
When their lessons were over
they played in the garden, or
swung, or sometimes rode upon
the donkey.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, as Alfred sat by the
door, he saw something run past
him, very swiftly. He called out,</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, Miss Lee, I see something!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you see, Alfred?”
said Miss Lee.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“A pretty little red thing, with
a long, bushy tail,” said he.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose it is a squirrel,”
said Miss Lee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O yes, ma’am,” said Alfred.
“it is a squirrel. I have seen
squirrels in the woods; but I
did not know that they ever lived
in a garden.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he said this, a little ground-squirrel,
with two young ones,
came out of a hole under the
green well-curb, by the school-house
door. At first they seemed
a little afraid; but the boys
were still, and the squirrels became
bolder. After that they
would pay Alfred and Walter a
daily visit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>They were wise little squirrels
to come and live with such
good people. They need not
fear mischievous boys, or cruel
guns, in that sweet, quiet place.</p>

</div>
<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I do not want to study,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It is so warm to-day;</div>
      <div class='line'>So I’ll run into the meadow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And roll among the hay.</div>
      <div class='c008'><span class='sc'>Charlotte Fox.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At length the time came when
Alfred’s pleasant visit must end.
When he was going away, Walter
gave Flora a very beautiful
box, as a keepsake. The box
was filled with sugar-plums.</p>

<p class='c007'>He also gave one to Alfred, on
which was a picture of a boy flying
a kite.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they were in the steam-boat,
Alfred brought the box to
his mother, and said,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Mamma, how many of these
sugar-plums may I eat to-day?”</p>

<p class='c007'>His mother said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had better give me the
box to keep for you, my dear;
and when you say your lessons
well, I will give you a few
sugar-plums at a time, as a reward.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred loved sugar-plums
very much; and he said he
would rather keep the box himself,
and eat them just when he
liked.</p>

<p class='c007'>His mother told him that if he
did he would eat them all up, as
the boy in the story-book eat his
cake, and very likely get as sick
as he; therefore he had better
give them to her to deal out to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>him. So Alfred consented that
his mamma should do this.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were some very hot days
after Alfred’s return to Norwood.
On one of these he felt very lazy,
and said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, mamma, my lesson is so
hard that I cannot get it to-day!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, instead of studying it,
he would play with his shoe-string,
or pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c007'>His mamma said, many times,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alfred, it is getting quite
late. Are you not ready to say
your lesson yet?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Alfred did not get ready
until twelve o’clock; and even
then did not know his first lesson
quite well; and the second
one had to be put off until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>afternoon. In the afternoon it
was hotter than it had been in
the morning. Alfred held his
book in his hand, and did everything
but study. He would lie
down upon the floor, and look
out of the window, although nothing
was to be seen there but
the still trees, and the drooping
flowers, and the parched grass,
and the hot, blinding sun, which
seemed to have frightened the
katydids, and the bees, and the
birds, into entire stillness.</p>

<p class='c007'>At night, when he went to bed,
he called to his mamma, who
was in the next room,</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, my sugar-plums, mamma!
I have not had my sugar-plums!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“No, I know you have not,
my dear. But why should you
have them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, because I love them!
And you know, mamma, I was
to have a few every day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, if you deserved them.
You know they were to be a
kind of reward; but you certainly
cannot, feel that you ought to
have any to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred confessed that he had
not deserved them, and said he
would try to do better the next
day; and so, after saying the
little verse which he used to
repeat after he had said his prayers,
he went to sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the verse which Alfred
said:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“At night I lay my little head</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To rest upon my nice soft bed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord, let thy holy angels keep</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thy watch around me while I sleep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After this Alfred got his lessons
well, even without sugar-plums.
He began to think, too,
that he was too large to eat them,
and gave them all away; although
he still kept the box with
the picture of the boy and the
kite on it. But it became quite
a saying among the children,
when any one wanted something
that they had not earned, “O,
you must not have the sugar-plums,
when you have not got
your lesson.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>One</span> sweet September morning,
Alfred’s papa rose early. Silvery
mists rested upon the mountains;
but when the sun arose
they parted, and curled upwards.
The industrious little spider, who
works when we sleep, had hung
fine silk threads over the dewy
blades of grass. The sky was
bright, and the air very still.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Penrose was going to take
a ride into the country; and Alfred
was to go with his papa. As
they stood by a window, waiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>for the carriage, they heard a
strange whirring sound. They
looked up into a wild cherry-tree,
that stood at a short distance from
the window, and saw so many
robins that they could not count
them. The little thieves were
stealing all the cherries. O, how
fast they picked and ate! The
robins did not belong there.
Other birds built their nests in
that tree; but the robins always
built in the mossy and crooked
apple-trees, on the other side of
the fence.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first Alfred was pleased to
see the robins enjoy the cherries;
but afterward he thought they
ate so many that none would be
left for the little birds who made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>their home in the shrubbery, and
sung for them all day long.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think Alfred never had a
pleasanter ride than on that day
with his papa. The road was
hilly; and a great part of it lay
through rich, dark woods. The
smell of the woods was delightful;
and beautiful mosses were
spread along the track of their
carriage. Now and then, little
brooks ran swiftly along, with a
gurgling sound; and gray squirrels
leaped among the branches
of the trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Penrose, who always tried
to say something that would do
his children good, when he was
with them, said to Alfred,</p>

<p class='c007'>“My son, you may say your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>text to me this morning, as you
did not say it at the breakfast-table.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Alfred repeated the text to
his father, which he had learned
the night before. It was this:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whosoever shall give to
drink unto one of these little
ones a cup of cold water only in
the name of a disciple, verily, I
say unto you, he shall in no
wise lose his reward.” Matthew
x, 42.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>When</span> Alfred had finished, his
father said, “That text tells us
that God knows when we are
kind to his children, and will reward
us for it at the judgment
day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, father,” said Alfred, “you
told me once that we did not deserve
reward for any good thing
which we ever did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We do not deserve any reward,”
said Mr. Penrose. “The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>wish in us to do anything right
comes from God. Yet, after he
has given us this disposition, he
rewards us for the exercise of it;
so, as the apostle Paul tells us,
‘It is all of grace.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does God never pay us in
this world for doing right?” said
Alfred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sometimes he <i>does</i> pay us,
even in this world, for being good
to his people. I will tell you,
Alfred, how he once rewarded a
man because he was kind to one
of his ministers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Many years, a great many
years ago, some wicked men
took one of God’s good ministers,
and put him in a dungeon. A
dungeon is a dark prison. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>dungeon in which this good
minister, or prophet, was put was
a doleful place under ground.
The bottom of it was full of soft,
filthy mud.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wicked people put him in
this sad place, because he feared
the Lord, and would say what
he bade him, instead of what the
enemies of the Lord wished.
They wanted him to say pleasant,
flattering things; but God
did not tell him these.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No doubt Jeremiah, for that
was the prophet’s name, prayed
to God from that dark dungeon.
Daniel cried to him from the
lions’ den, and Jonah prayed to
him when the darkness wrapped
him about. Man could not hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Jonah’s voice from the midst of
the seas; but God heard both
Daniel and Jonah. And he also
heard the voice of his faithful
Jeremiah from the deep, damp
dungeon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God put it in the heart of a
man, who lived in the king’s
house, to remember Jeremiah,
and to pity him. This good
man went to the king, and
said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Those are wicked people
who have cast Jeremiah into the
dungeon. He will die for hunger.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The king told this man to
take some persons to help him,
and to draw Jeremiah out of the
dungeon.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“Then this kind man let some
ropes into the dungeon, and drew
Jeremiah out of it. He made
him put some old linen, which
he threw down to him, under his
arms, lest the ropes should hurt
him. So he was very tender toward
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now because the man had
done this thing to one of God’s
faithful ones, God remembered
him when, some time after, fierce
soldiers came against the city,
and killed almost all the people.
He was not hurt because of his
kindness to the prophet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So you see, Alfred, <i>he</i> was
paid for it in this world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will find this story in
the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>chapters of the book of
Jeremiah. “When you get home

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Just</span> as Alfred’s papa had
finished saying these words they
reached the gate of the house
where they were to breakfast. It
belonged to a friend of Mr. Penrose,
who wished to see him on
some business; and Mr. Penrose
had chosen the early part of the
day for the visit, because he was
generally much engaged at other
times.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred saw that the gentleman
looked very serious; and that no
lady sat down to the breakfast-table
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>with them. There were
two children; a little boy about
the age of Alfred, and a sister
who was older. The little boy’s
name was William. He looked
pale and sad; and Alfred could
not help feeling sorry for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>After they had finished eating
breakfast, William’s papa told
him that he might take Alfred
out into the garden, to walk.
Rosa also went with them, and
seemed very cheerful and kind;
and showed Alfred her rabbits,
and her birds and flowers. She
said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“William used to love these,
and helped me to take care of
them once; but he does not care
anything about them now.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>When Rosa said this, Alfred
saw the tears come into William’s
eyes, and he wished Rosa
had not spoken so.</p>

<p class='c007'>William said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did love them when mamma
was here, Rosa; but now
everything makes me feel sorry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Rosa turned red, and
went into the house; and William
cried very much, as Alfred
stood by him. Alfred said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Has your mamma gone away
from you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said little William,
“my mamma died two weeks
ago. I know she has gone to
heaven; but I miss her very
much. Nobody loves me as she
did.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Alfred felt ready to cry too.
He said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you know if you are a
good boy you will go to heaven
too, William, and see your dear
mamma in that beautiful place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know it,” said William.
“She told me so before
she died. She said if I was a
good boy it would not be long
before I should come to her; and
that then she would not go away
from me any more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alfred was an affectionate
child. His heart was full of sorrow
for little William. All the
way home he could talk of nothing
else: but he was glad
when his papa told him that
William’s father had promised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>to let his little boy come over, on
the next week, and spend several
days with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>William came; and soon felt
quite at home. Mrs. Penrose
liked to hear him talk of his
good mother; and all the family
loved him, for he was a good-tempered
and interesting little
fellow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evening after Alfred’s first
visit to William, he told his sister
Jane about him. The next
morning she brought him a
folded paper, and, as she opened
it, said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alfred, I thought so much
of your little friend last night
that I wrote some verses about
him, which I will read to you.”</p>

      <div class='line'>Since I have felt her gentle hand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Laid kindly on my head.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The hour I loved so dearly once,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Now only sorrow brings;</div>
      <div class='line'>No mother reads the word of life,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or song of Zion sings.</div>
      <div class='line'>A stranger comes, with careless voice</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And bids for bed prepare;</div>
      <div class='line'>And often hardly gives me time</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To say a hurried prayer.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Although this room is just the same,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It wears a mournful look;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet here’s her bed, and here’s the stand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which bears the holy book,</div>
      <div class='line'>That tells me of another land,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In which she dwelleth now:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>O, often o’er that book she bent,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With pale and earnest brow!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In other days this little room</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A temple seem’d to me;</div>
      <div class='line'>She taught me here to worship God</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In truth and purity.</div>
      <div class='line'>The fields beneath the window smile,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And wear their summer hue;</div>
      <div class='line'>The flowers she nursed look gay and bright,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As when they met her view.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yet, O, to me no thought of joy</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This happy season bears;</div>
      <div class='line'>All dimm’d are these delightful scenes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With thick and blinding tears.</div>
      <div class='line'>I cannot laugh as once I could,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Nor hide the deep distress</div>
      <div class='line'>That breaks my heart, when I reflect</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That I am motherless.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And, sister, when I see you stand,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With such an anxious air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Before the glass, your sash to fix,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And smooth your braided hair;</div>
      <div class='line'>I think of one so far above</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The petty pride of dress;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who only shone in plain attire</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And simple loveliness.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>She’s gone! but let her image sweet</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Be in our memory set;</div>
      <div class='line'>And her example, pure and bright,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ah, let us not forget!</div>
      <div class='line'>We see her not; but I believe</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her mild and pitying-eye</div>
      <div class='line'>From heaven with anxious love looks down,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Our actions to espy.</div>
